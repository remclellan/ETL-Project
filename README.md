# ETL Project

## Can grocery delivery services help reach food insecure regions?

**Sources:**
- USDA ERS Food Access Research Atlas (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/download-the-data/)- csv
- Instacart service areas (https://www.instacart.com/grocery-delivery/regions) - web scrape
- US Zip Codes (to link cities to counties) (https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/zip-code-database/)- csv

**Analysis**

Applying ETL to the datasets connected the service area of Instacart to the Food Deserts within the states they operate today.  While the datasets had limitations and there were workarounds to the data to find common ground, the data clearly showed that there were areas of Low Income/Low Access in which Instacart reaches today and may help curb the access issue with regards to fresh foods in those some of those areas.  The datasets also revealed the prevalence of the Urban Food Deserts with limited access being a shorter radius but hampered by access to transportation as well.  This was defintely an area where food delivery in this case grocery delivery can help meet a need when the person cannot get to the store themselves.

In all, within the states currently operating, there was a meaninful impact of over 35% of the identifiable areas.  This may need to be adjustsed as not all cities and countiers were able to match due to spelling syntax preferences between the data sets. Additionally, this was at a county level and some areas food deserts may be pockets within counties that the service areas do not reach yet.  Further analysis based on zip codes or census tract to get to a finer level of detail would help perfect the analysis.  Also, as this was only based on one providers service region, there may be a more broad reach into the food deserts from multiple avenues such as local grocery stores offering delivery, competitors to the provider used for this analysis and even the meal delivery service industry who may ship to those areas.
